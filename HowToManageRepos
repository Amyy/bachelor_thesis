Changed decription for primary host: GitHub
(GitLab only reachable out of university clinicum network)

Set Github to primary host. (git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Amyy/thesis-template.git)
Then add GitLab as remote:

git remote add gitlab git@g27vmgitlab:WAGNERAME/thesis-template.git

Now, you can interact with GitLab or GitHub specifically.
“origin” name: refers to your primary host, Github.  
This new “github” remote name refers to GitLab 
(and you’re free to use any other name you like instead, it’s only for human-readability).

To push changes to either repository, use:

git push origin   (GitHub)

git push gitlab   (GitLab)

You would pull down changes in similar fashion:

git pull origin   (GitHub)

git pull gitlab   (GitLab)

As you do work on your GitHub primary host:
You would just periodically update the GitHub mirror by pushing the “master” branch there.
Conversely, if someone in the community submits a pull request to your GitLab mirror, then the workflow would look like:

    Review and merge the pull request on GitLab
    Pull “master” into your local workspace
    Push “master” to GitHub

This is definitely a bit more manual shuffling than you would have with a single remote.
However, it gives you maximum flexibility, and after a time or two it becomes automatic.
